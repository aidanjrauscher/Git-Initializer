# Git Initializer

*Built by Aidan Rauscher*

This is a Batch script that automates the process of initializing a new Git repository, and connecting it to a remote repository. 

The script creates a new folder at your current directory location, changes directory, creates an empty README, then initializes the repository and sets up the remote origin. 

Run in command line using:
  
  C:PATH\git-init.bat [remote-repository-name]
